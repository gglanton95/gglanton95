            <b>Crown shyness</b> <i>(also canopy disengagement,<sup>[1]</sup> 
            canopy shyness,<sup>[2]</sup> or inter-crown spacing<sup>[3]</sup>)</i> 
            is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the 
            crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, 
            forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup> The 
            phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, 
            but also occurs between trees of different species.<sup>[6][7]</sup> 
            There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an 
            adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit 
            spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>
